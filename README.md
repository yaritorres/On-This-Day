# On-This-Day

This is a single-page webapp created in less than 2 days for the sole purpose of finding out what happened on a certain day and month in history.

## Getting Started
```
npm install
```

## Running The App In Your Browser
```
npm start
npm run dev
```
This will start the webpack dev server and express server for making requests to the API.

If you'd like to just run a build of the app, instead use:
```
npm run build
npm start
```
You'll find the app hosted on localhost:3000.
