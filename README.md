# On-This-Day

This is a single-page webapp created in less than 2 days for the sole purpose of finding out what happened on a certain day and month in history.

## Getting Started
```
npm install
```
This will install all the dependencies necessary to run the app in your browser.

## Running The App In Your Browser
```
npm start
npm run dev
```
This will first start the Express server to make API calls and then the webpack dev server. Any changes made to files will refresh the page and be shown.

## If you'd like to just run a build of the app, instead use:
```
npm run build
npm start
```
You'll find the app hosted on localhost:3000.
